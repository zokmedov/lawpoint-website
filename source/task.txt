I need to create a website for a Canadian immigration law firm. The concept is as follows:

1. The website is typography-focused, with very little use of images (mostly a logo and necessary illustrations inside the content pages).
2. Website visual style must be closely based on my legal documents visual style, which is defined as styles in an MS Word document.
3. Background will be white or off-white, text will be black or dark, to create overall resemblance of text printed on paper.
4. Graphic elements will be minimal and include simple dividing lines, borders around menu items etc.
5. Website will have the following structure:
  a) scrollable home page (main menu, hero section, several generic text-based sections, section with links to content pages, contact form, footer);
  b) content pages that will all be based on a single template;
  c) about / contacts page;
  d) consultation scheduling page;
  e) payment processing pages (checkout page);
  f) simple generic notification template (for 404 pages, confirmation messages etc.)
  
The visual style must be based on the legal document, but may need to be adapted for web readability in terms of font size etc. on different screens sizes.
Main properties (such as main colors, serif/sans serif, font size, line interval etc.) are to be declared as CSS variables where possible for ease of fine-tuning in the future.

Reference files:

/source/Memorandum.docx - the reference document, contains pre-defined styles
/source/Memorandum.pdf - same reference document in PDF format for visual reference

The following styles are to be used:

(normal) - for normal text
(numbered) - for numbered paragraphs
(offset) - for unnumbered paragraphs with same left offset as numbered paragraphs
(reference) - for citations and references
(list) - for unnumbered bullet lists
(section) - for section headers
(subsection) - for subsection headers
(law) - for citing from law
(quote) - for citing from other sources

We won't need any other styles present in Memorandum.docx.
See the PDF version of the same document for overall look and feel.

Create a CSS Design System — translate Word styles into CSS variables and classes, adapting font sizes for web readability.
Build a Style Preview Page — A simple HTML page showing all typography styles to review and fine-tune before we build the full website.
Develop the Website Structure — Once styles are approved, build out the page templates (home, content, contacts, scheduling, checkout, notification).
