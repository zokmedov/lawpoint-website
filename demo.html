                        This memorandum is prepared on behalf of Elena Vasquez Moreno (the "Applicant"), a citizen of

                        Skilled Worker Program ("FSWP"). The Applicant seeks to establish that she meets all
                        eligibility requirements as set out in the <em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</em>,
                        S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the "Act") and the <em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations</em>,

                    <p class="text-normal">
                        The Applicant is a 34-year-old software engineer with <span class="highlight">over ten years of professional experience</span>
                        in full-stack web development, cloud architecture, and team leadership. She holds a Master of
                        Science in Computer Engineering from the Universidad de los Andes in Bogota, and has been
                        employed continuously since 2014 in progressively senior technical roles. Her Canadian Language

                        Canada. The evidence, which we summarize below, establishes that she comfortably exceeds the
                        minimum requirements at every stage of the selection process.

                            completed in December 2015. Her thesis examined distributed systems architecture for
                            high-availability financial applications.</li>

                        <li>From January 2014 to August 2018, the Applicant was employed as a Software Developer and
                            subsequently as a Senior Software Developer at TechCorp Solutions S.A.S., a mid-size technology
                            firm headquartered in Bogota. During this period she was responsible for designing and

                <h3 class="text-subsection">Selection Criteria and Points Grid</h3>

                <p class="text-normal">
                    Once minimum eligibility is established, the applicant is assessed against the six selection
                    factors enumerated in section 76(1) of the Regulations. The current pass mark is 67 points out
                    of a possible 100. The factors and their maximum point values are as follows:
                </p>

                <ol class="numbered-list">
                    <li><strong>Education</strong> (maximum 25 points): Points are awarded based on the level of
                        educational attainment, with a Master's degree at a university attracting 23 points and a
                        doctoral degree attracting the full 25.</li>
                    <li><strong>Official Languages Proficiency</strong> (maximum 28 points): Points are allocated
                        based on the applicant's scores in the four language abilities (reading, writing, listening,
                        speaking) in one or both of Canada's official languages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Work Experience</strong> (maximum 15 points): Points increase with the number of
                        years of qualifying full-time work experience, from 9 points for one year to the maximum 15
                        for six or more years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Age</strong> (maximum 12 points): The maximum is awarded to applicants between the
                        ages of 18 and 35, with points decreasing by one for each year over 35.</li>
                    <li><strong>Arranged Employment</strong> (maximum 10 points): Points are awarded if the applicant
                        has a valid job offer from a Canadian employer supported by a positive Labour Market Impact
                        Assessment or an exemption therefrom.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adaptability</strong> (maximum 10 points): Points are awarded for factors including
                        prior Canadian work or study experience, having relatives in Canada, and the spouse's
                        education or language ability.</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="text-offset">
                    It should be noted that the selection grid operates independently of the Comprehensive Ranking
                    System ("CRS") used within the Express Entry system to rank candidates for invitations to apply.
                    An applicant must meet the 67-point threshold under section 76 to be eligible, but her actual
                    ranking in the Express Entry pool depends on her CRS score, which incorporates additional factors
                    such as skills transferability and Canadian job offers.

                <h2 class="text-section">Jurisprudence</h2>

                <p class="text-normal">
                    The Federal Court has consistently held that officers assessing FSWP applications must evaluate
                    the evidence as a whole and may not reject an application on the basis of a single deficiency
                    without considering the totality of the record. In <em>Malik v. Canada (Citizenship and
                    Immigration)</em>, Justice Mosley emphasized the importance of a holistic assessment:
                </p>

                <p class="text-quote">
                    "The officer's duty is to weigh the evidence in its entirety and to assess whether, on a balance
                    of probabilities, the applicant has demonstrated that she possesses the qualifications claimed.
                    An officer who focuses on a single perceived weakness to the exclusion of the broader evidentiary
                    record commits a reviewable error."
                </p>

                <p class="text-reference">
                    Malik v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 990 at para 28
                </p>

                <p class="text-normal">
                    Similarly, in <em>Chen v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, the Court found
                    that an officer's failure to consider the applicant's entire professional history, including
                    supervisory responsibilities and progressive career advancement, rendered the decision
                    unreasonable.
                </p>

                <blockquote class="quote-citation">
                    "Where the evidence clearly demonstrates a pattern of increasing responsibility and skill
                    development over many years, it is unreasonable for the officer to dismiss the applicant's
                    claimed experience on the basis of minor inconsistencies in job descriptions."

                    certificates from Colombia (where she has resided for the majority of her adult life) and from
                    Canada (covering her period of residence in Toronto). Both certificates confirm that no criminal
                    record exists. The Applicant has never been refused a visa or denied entry to any country,
                    and has no history of immigration violations.

                    Bogota. The results of the examination have been transmitted directly to Immigration, Refugees
                    and Citizenship Canada through the eMedical system. The Applicant is in good health and has no
                    medical conditions that would render her inadmissible under section 38 of the Act.

                    For the reasons set out above, the Applicant respectfully submits that her application for
                    permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Program should be approved. The evidence
                    demonstrates, clearly and convincingly, that she meets and exceeds every minimum eligibility
                    requirement prescribed by the Act and the Regulations. Her projected selection score of 84
                    points surpasses the pass mark by a wide margin. She is admissible on all grounds, possesses
                    settlement funds far in excess of the minimum, and has articulated a genuine, well-supported
                    intention to establish herself permanently in Canada.
